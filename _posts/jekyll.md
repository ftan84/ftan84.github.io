...you see, I've met someone. I've only just met her, but yet there's something
very familiar about her -- it's as if I've known her for years. She loves to
travel and the best part about it -- she packs light. She can fit everything
that she needs in a tiny suitcase and can travel everywhere with it. So,

Of course I'm talking about Jekyll.
