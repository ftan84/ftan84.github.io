Welcome to my new blog! My name is Francis Tan and I am an aspiring Data
Scientist. I am passionate about the field and am always interested in learning
more. A bit about myself -- I have a B.S. in Computer Science and an M.B.A and
I am hoping that my two degrees can combine into a super power! :) Yes, that was
cheesy, but hey, hopefully it will make for a more enjoyable read. And yes, I
will likely get a lot of groans and eye rolls from you guys so let me know in
the comments if I am overdoing it with the cheese -- I have been told, afterall,
that I make a lot of dad jokes...

Speaking of cheese -- what's up with that site title? Well there's a quote in
computer science that I thought was particularly appropriate in this situation
and it goes something like this:

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and
> naming things." -- Phil Karlton

The title is sort of a play on the `train()` function found in the `caret`
package in R. Essentially, you "feed" the train function with training data and
what it returns is a _fit_ object based on the method chosen. That new _fit_
object can then be applied to make predictions based on the data it has
"learned." Since this site is really a record on the Data Science learnings I
am acquiring, I thought a play on something like
`francis <- train(machine_learning)` or `FT <- train(DataScience)` would be
kind of cool. In the end, `train(DataScience)` seemed succinct and
display-friendly enough for a site title.

So with that said, here's what to expect from this site. You'll mostly find my
notes on various topics on Data Science/tech related stuff -- bear in mind that
I've written these notes mostly for my own safe keeping. Given my coding
background, I don't intend on diving too much into the coding basics but more
around the ideas of the subject matter itself. So my notes will be rather terse
and to the point and you'll generally find they are mostly made up of code
snippets with the occasional explanation where appropriate.

I hope you guys will find this site helpful and enjoyable. Also, I know there
are many of you out there far more qualified to explain the concepts on this
site, so please point out my errors where you see fit in the comments. I am
all for knowledge sharing and my hope is that my posts will stimulate some
very interesting discussions. Thanks and welcome!
