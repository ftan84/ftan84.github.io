Hi! My name is Francis Tan and welcome to my site. I am a lifelong learner in
pursuit of mastering the art (and science) of Data Science. I have created this
site to showcase my work, my passion, and my experiments and to share the
knowledge and learnings I have encountered on my journey to learning the trade.

Please have a look at some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/ftan84).
